# Phase 2: Methodical Planning (Config: GEMINI_WITH_REASONING)

<reasoning>
The user wants an analysis plan based on the provided project structure and initial findings.
1.  **Project Structure Analysis:** The project contains only one file: `greptile-mcp-implemention.md`. This is a Markdown file.
2.  **Initial Findings Analysis:** The findings confirm the project's simplicity, consisting solely of this Markdown file. They highlight that the file likely contains documentation or planning related to an implementation ("greptile-mcp"). The findings also emphasize that while the *structure* doesn't reveal much, the *content* of the Markdown file is key to understanding the actual implementation, potential dependencies, and tech stack discussed.
3.  **Agent Creation Strategy:** Given the single file is Markdown and describes an implementation, the required expertise involves:
    *   Understanding documentation formats (Markdown).
    *   Analyzing technical content within documentation (implementation details, concepts).
    *   Potentially identifying architectural elements described.
    Therefore, three agents are suitable: one focusing on documentation standards, one on the technical content/implementation details, and one on system design/architecture described within the document.
4.  **File Assignment Strategy:** Since there is only one file, `greptile-mcp-implemention.md`, it needs to be assigned to the agent(s) best suited to analyze its primary purpose. Based on the name and findings, the file's core value lies in the technical implementation details it describes. Thus, the Technical Analyst is the most appropriate primary assignee.
