# Task ID: 4
# Title: Set Up Unit Tests for Client Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive unit testing framework for the Greptile client implementation.
# Details:
Develop unit tests to verify the correct functionality of the Greptile client implementation. Tests should cover API request handling, response parsing, error handling, authentication, and other core client functions. Use mocking to simulate API responses and error conditions.

# Test Strategy:
Implement test coverage metrics and aim for at least 80% code coverage. Ensure tests run as part of CI/CD pipeline.

# Subtasks:
## 4.1. Set Up Testing Framework and Environment [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the testing framework and environment for the client tests.
### Details:
Set up the testing framework (pytest) with appropriate configurations, fixtures, and utilities for testing the Greptile client. Create a testing environment with mocks and stubs for external dependencies.

## 4.2. Create API Request Formation Tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop tests for API request formation and parameter validation.
### Details:
Create unit tests that verify correct API request formation, URL construction, header setting, and parameter validation for all client methods. Tests should cover both valid and invalid parameter scenarios.

## 4.3. Implement Authentication and Authorization Tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create tests for authentication and authorization functionality.
### Details:
Implement tests for authentication and authorization functionality, including API key validation, token handling, and authentication error scenarios. Tests should verify that authentication information is properly included in requests.

## 4.4. Develop Response Parsing and Handling Tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create tests for response parsing and handling logic.
### Details:
Develop comprehensive tests for response parsing and handling logic, including successful responses, error responses, and edge cases like empty or malformed responses. Verify that response data is correctly transformed into the expected formats.

## 4.5. Implement Error Handling and Recovery Tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create tests for error handling and recovery mechanisms.
### Details:
Implement tests for error handling and recovery mechanisms, including network errors, timeouts, rate limits, and server errors. Verify that errors are properly caught, logged, and handled according to the defined error policies.

## 4.6. Set Up Test Coverage Reporting [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure test coverage reporting and tracking.
### Details:
Set up test coverage reporting and tracking to measure the effectiveness of the test suite. Configure tools to generate coverage reports, set up thresholds for acceptable coverage, and integrate with the development workflow.
