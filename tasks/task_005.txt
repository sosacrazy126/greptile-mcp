# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Integration Tests for MCP Tools
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement integration tests that verify the proper functioning of all MCP tools with the Greptile API.
# Details:
Develop integration tests for all four MCP tools: repository indexing, querying, searching, and information retrieval. Tests should validate the proper integration between the MCP server and the Greptile API, including error handling and response processing.

# Test Strategy:
Create test scenarios that cover normal operation, error conditions, edge cases, and performance considerations. Tests should run against a test repository to validate actual API integration.

# Subtasks:
## 5.1. Implement Repository Indexing Integration Tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create integration tests for the repository indexing tool.
### Details:
Develop integration tests for the repository indexing tool that validate its interaction with the Greptile API. Tests should cover successful indexing, error handling, status checking, and various repository configurations.

## 5.2. Create Repository Querying Integration Tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop integration tests for the repository querying tool.
### Details:
Create comprehensive integration tests for the repository querying tool that verify its ability to send queries to the Greptile API and process the responses correctly. Tests should cover various query types, response formats, and error conditions.

## 5.3. Implement Repository Searching Integration Tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop integration tests for the repository searching tool.
### Details:
Implement integration tests for the repository searching tool that validate its ability to search repositories for relevant files. Tests should verify correct search parameter handling, result processing, and error management.

## 5.4. Create Repository Information Retrieval Tests [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop integration tests for the repository information retrieval tool.
### Details:
Create integration tests for the repository information retrieval tool that verify its ability to fetch metadata about indexed repositories. Tests should cover various repository states, formats, and error conditions.

## 5.5. Implement End-to-End Testing Scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop end-to-end test scenarios that use multiple MCP tools together.
### Details:
Create comprehensive end-to-end test scenarios that validate the interaction between multiple MCP tools in sequence (e.g., indexing a repository and then querying it). Tests should verify correct data flow and state management between operations.
