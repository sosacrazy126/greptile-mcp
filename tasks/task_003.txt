# Task ID: 3
# Title: Add Caching Mechanism for Frequent API Calls
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement caching to reduce API usage and improve response times for frequently requested data.
# Details:
Design and implement a caching system for frequently made API calls to reduce overall API usage and improve response times. This should include configurable TTL (Time-To-Live) settings, cache invalidation strategies, and memory management to prevent excessive resource usage.

# Test Strategy:
Test cache hit/miss ratios, verify cache invalidation works correctly, and measure performance improvements with the caching layer enabled vs. disabled.

# Subtasks:
## 3.1. Design Cache Key Generation System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a robust cache key generation system for API calls.
### Details:
Design and implement a cache key generation system that creates unique and consistent keys for API calls based on their parameters and context. The system should handle complex data structures and ensure cache hits for identical requests.

## 3.2. Implement In-Memory Cache Store [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an efficient in-memory cache store for API responses.
### Details:
Develop an in-memory cache store for API responses that balances performance and memory usage. Implement data structures that allow for fast lookups while preventing memory leaks and excessive resource consumption.

## 3.3. Add TTL and Cache Invalidation Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement TTL settings and cache invalidation strategies.
### Details:
Add configurable Time-To-Live (TTL) settings for cached items and implement cache invalidation strategies including expiration-based, update-based, and explicit invalidation. Ensure the system can handle varying freshness requirements for different types of data.

## 3.4. Create Cache Size Management and Eviction Policies [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement cache size management and eviction policies to control memory usage.
### Details:
Build a cache size management system with configurable limits and intelligent eviction policies (LRU, LFU, etc.) to prevent memory problems. Include monitoring capabilities to track cache size and performance metrics.

## 3.5. Integrate Caching with API Client [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the caching system with the Greptile API client.
### Details:
Integrate the caching system with the Greptile API client code to intercept and cache appropriate requests. Include options to bypass the cache when needed and handle cache misses transparently.
