# Task ID: 1
# Title: Enhance Streaming Support for Query Responses
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement improved streaming capabilities for query responses to enhance real-time feedback and user experience.
# Details:
Enhance the current implementation to provide better streaming support for query responses. This includes implementing server-sent events (SSE) and improving real-time data transmission for repository queries. The implementation should handle large repository queries efficiently and provide immediate feedback for long-running operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test streaming functionality with large repository queries to ensure proper transmission and error handling. Verify real-time updates are delivered correctly using both SSE and stdio protocols.

# Subtasks:
## 1.1. Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for Streaming Responses [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up SSE protocol support for real-time streaming of query results.
### Details:
Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) protocol support in the MCP server to enable real-time streaming of query responses to clients. This includes setting up proper event formatting, content-type headers, and connection management. The implementation should allow clients to receive incremental updates as query results become available.

## 1.2. Enhance Standard I/O Transport for Streaming [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Improve stdio transport layer to support real-time streaming of query results.
### Details:
Enhance the stdio transport layer to properly handle streaming data with appropriate encoding and chunking. Ensure proper buffer management and data formatting for stdio-based clients, including handling for newlines, backpressure, and flow control.

## 1.3. Implement Error Handling for Streaming Connections [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create robust error handling for streaming connections to handle disconnections and failures.
### Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling for streaming connections, including graceful handling of client disconnections, server errors during streaming, and network interruptions. The system should be able to recover from errors and provide meaningful error information to clients.

## 1.4. Add Timeout and Keepalive Mechanisms [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement timeout and keepalive mechanisms for long-running streaming operations.
### Details:
Develop timeout controls and keepalive mechanisms for long-running streaming operations to prevent resource exhaustion and maintain connection health. This includes implementing heartbeat messages, configurable timeouts, and graceful connection termination procedures.

## 1.5. Implement Buffer Management and Flow Control [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create buffer management and flow control mechanisms for efficient streaming.
### Details:
Implement efficient buffer management and flow control mechanisms to handle varying client consumption rates and prevent memory issues with large result sets. This includes chunk size optimization, backpressure handling, and memory usage monitoring.

## 1.6. Add Stream Progress Reporting [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement progress reporting for long-running streaming operations.
### Details:
Add progress reporting capabilities to streaming responses to provide clients with information about the status of long-running operations. This includes reporting on indexing progress, query execution stages, and estimated completion times.
