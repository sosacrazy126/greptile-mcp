# Greptile MCP - Product Requirements Document

# Overview
Greptile MCP (Mission Control Platform) is a system that integrates with the Greptile API to provide code repository search, querying, and analysis capabilities to AI agents. It enables AI systems to effectively understand and analyze code repositories through a standardized interface, maintaining persistent context across conversations via a memory bank.

# Core Features

## 1. MCP Server Implementation
- **What it does**: Provides a FastMCP server implementation that exposes Greptile functionality as standardized tools.
- **Why it's important**: Enables AI agents to access Greptile capabilities through a consistent interface.
- **How it works**: Implements four essential tools as FastMCP endpoints for repository indexing, querying, searching, and information retrieval.

## 2. Greptile API Client
- **What it does**: Communicates with the Greptile API for code repository operations.
- **Why it's important**: Forms the core functionality layer that enables repository indexing and querying.
- **How it works**: Implements asynchronous communication with proper error handling, authentication, and response parsing.

## 3. Persistent Memory Bank
- **What it does**: Maintains context and state across multiple conversations and sessions.
- **Why it's important**: Provides continuity in interactions and eliminates the need for repetitive setup.
- **How it works**: Uses a hardset session ID system with markdown files for storing context, tasks, and progress.

## 4. Streaming Support
- **What it does**: Enables real-time streaming of query responses.
- **Why it's important**: Provides immediate feedback for long-running operations and improves user experience.
- **How it works**: Implements server-sent events (SSE) and standard I/O support for different consumption patterns.

# User Experience

## User Personas
- **AI Agent Developers**: Technical users who integrate Greptile capabilities into AI systems.
- **AI Agents**: The systems themselves that need code understanding capabilities.
- **End Users**: Who interact with AI agents and indirectly use Greptile MCP services.

## Key User Flows
- Repository indexing for later analysis
- Repository querying with natural language
- Repository searching for relevant files
- Repository information retrieval

## UI/UX Considerations
- Clean API interface for programmatic access
- Consistent error handling and feedback
- Clear documentation and usage examples

# Technical Architecture

# Risks and Mitigations

## Technical Challenges
- **Risk**: API changes in Greptile could break functionality
- **Mitigation**: Implement version tracking and robust error handling

## Performance Concerns
- **Risk**: Large repository indexing could cause timeout issues
- **Mitigation**: Implement streaming, pagination, and async processing

## Resource Constraints
- **Risk**: API rate limiting could impact usability
- **Mitigation**: Implement caching and rate limit awareness
