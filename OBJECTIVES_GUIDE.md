### Scenario 1: Adding Google Sign-In to Your App

**Objective**: Add Google authentication to an existing application

```python
# Step 1: Index your application
await index_repository(ctx, "github", "mycompany/myapp", "main")

# Step 2: Understand current auth
repos = [{"remote": "github", "repository": "mycompany/myapp", "branch": "main"}]
await query_repository(ctx, 
    "How does authentication currently work in this codebase?", 
    repos
)

# Step 3: Add auth library context (e.g., NextAuth)
await index_repository(ctx, "github", "nextauthjs/next-auth", "main")

# Step 4: Get implementation instructions
repos = [
    {"remote": "github", "repository": "mycompany/myapp", "branch": "main"},
    {"remote": "github", "repository": "nextauthjs/next-auth", "branch": "main"}
]
result = await query_repository(ctx,
    "How do I add Google Sign-in? Give me step-by-step instructions including: " +
    "1. Required libraries to install " +
    "2. Google provider configuration " +
    "3. Environment variables needed " +
    "4. Code changes required " +
    "5. How to test the integration",
    repos
)
```

Greptile will provide:
- Installation commands
- Configuration code
- Environment setup
- Component updates

### Scenario 2: Understanding a New Codebase

**Objective**: Quickly get up to speed on an unfamiliar project

```python
# Step 1: Index the project
await index_repository(ctx, "github", "strapi/strapi", "main")

# Step 2: Ask architectural questions
repos = [{"remote": "github", "repository": "strapi/strapi", "branch": "main"}]

# Understand overall architecture
await query_repository(ctx, 
    "Explain the overall architecture of this project", 
    repos
)

# Understand specific systems
await query_repository(ctx, 
    "How does the plugin system work?", 
    repos
)

# Understand data flow
await query_repository(ctx, 
    "How does data flow from API requests to the database?", 
    repos
)

# Find starting points
await query_repository(ctx, 
    "Where should I start if I want to add a new feature?", 
    repos
)
```

### Scenario 3: Implementing a New Feature

**Objective**: Add rate limiting to an Express API

```python
# Step 1: Index your API and Express
await index_repository(ctx, "github", "mycompany/api", "main")
await index_repository(ctx, "github", "expressjs/express", "master")

# Step 2: Research best practices
repos = [
    {"remote": "github", "repository": "expressjs/express", "branch": "master"}
]
await query_repository(ctx,
    "What are the best practices for implementing rate limiting in Express?",
    repos
)

# Step 3: Get implementation guide
repos = [
    {"remote": "github", "repository": "mycompany/api", "branch": "main"},
    {"remote": "github", "repository": "expressjs/express", "branch": "master"}
]
result = await query_repository(ctx,
    "How do I add rate limiting to this API? Include: " +
    "1. Recommended libraries " +
    "2. Where to add the middleware " +
    "3. Configuration options " +
    "4. How to handle rate limit errors " +
    "5. Testing approach",
    repos
)
```

### Scenario 4: Debugging Production Issues

**Objective**: Find why authentication is failing in production

```python
# Step 1: Index your app and auth library
repos = [
    {"remote": "github", "repository": "mycompany/app", "branch": "main"},
    {"remote": "github", "repository": "auth0/node-auth0", "branch": "master"}
]

# Step 2: Trace auth flow
await query_repository(ctx,
    "Trace the complete authentication flow from login to token validation",
    repos
)

# Step 3: Find failure points
await query_repository(ctx,
    "What are the common failure points in this auth flow? " +
    "What could cause intermittent auth failures?",
    repos
)

# Step 4: Get debugging steps
await query_repository(ctx,
    "How can I debug authentication failures? " +
    "What logs should I check? " +
    "What are the key validation points?",
    repos
)
```
