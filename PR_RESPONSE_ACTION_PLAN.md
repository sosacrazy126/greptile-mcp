- **API_DOCUMENTATION.md** - JSON-RPC endpoint reference
- **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Transition from MCP-only to dual mode

### **🟡 IMPORTANT - Should Include**

#### **5. Security Implementation**
```python
# Required security features:
- API key authentication middleware
- Rate limiting per endpoint
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for production
```

#### **6. Testing Coverage**
```python
# Required test coverage:
- HTTP endpoint functionality tests
- JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance tests  
- Error handling scenario tests
- Integration with existing MCP tools
- Performance benchmarking
```

## 🏗️ **Architecture Integration Strategy**

### **Dual Mode Support Pattern**
```
Mode Selection:
├── MCP Mode (existing)
│   ├── python -m src.main
│   ├── stdio transport
│   └── Direct MCP client integration
└── HTTP Mode (new)
    ├── python -m src.main_http
    ├── HTTP/JSON-RPC transport
    └── Web API integration
```

### **Shared Business Logic**
```python
# Both modes use same underlying services:
HTTP Request → JSON-RPC → MCP Handler → Service → Greptile API
MCP Request → MCP Handler → Service → Greptile API
```

### **Backward Compatibility Guarantee**
- ✅ **Existing MCP clients**: Continue working unchanged
- ✅ **Response formats**: Identical JSON structure
- ✅ **Session management**: Same UUID and conversation flow
- ✅ **Environment variables**: No configuration changes required

## 🚀 **Deployment Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Staged Deployment**
```bash
# Development testing
python -m src.main          # Test existing MCP mode
python -m src.main_http     # Test new HTTP mode
python -m pytest src/tests/ # Validate all functionality
```

### **Phase 2: Production Options**
```yaml
# Option A: MCP-only deployment (existing)
services:
  greptile-mcp:
    command: python -m src.main
    ports: []  # stdio only

# Option B: HTTP-only deployment (new)
services:
  greptile-http:
    command: python -m src.main_http
    ports: ["8080:8080"]

# Option C: Dual deployment (both)
services:
  greptile-mcp:
    command: python -m src.main
  greptile-http:
    command: python -m src.main_http
    ports: ["8080:8080"]
```

## 📋 **Reviewer Questions - Answered**

### **1. "Why were all .cursor/ files removed?"**
**Answer**: This appears to be an oversight. Development configuration files are essential and have been restored. The PR should include these files to maintain development workflow continuity.

### **2. "Where is the FastAPI implementation?"**
**Answer**: The implementation is missing from the PR diff. Complete example implementations have been provided showing exactly what should be included.

### **3. "How does this integrate with existing MCP?"**
**Answer**: The integration uses a shared service layer approach. Both HTTP and MCP modes use the same business logic, ensuring consistency and maintainability.

### **4. "What's the deployment strategy?"**
**Answer**: Dual mode support allows flexible deployment options. Organizations can choose MCP-only, HTTP-only, or both simultaneously based on their needs.

## ✅ **Success Criteria for Re-Review**

### **Before PR Re-Approval:**
1. ✅ **Development files restored** - .cursor/ directory with proper configuration
2. ✅ **Complete implementation shown** - FastAPI server and all supporting files visible
3. ✅ **Documentation updated** - HTTP usage, API reference, migration guide
4. ✅ **Security measures included** - Authentication, rate limiting, validation
5. ✅ **Testing provided** - HTTP endpoints, JSON-RPC compliance, integration
6. ✅ **Architecture documented** - Clear integration patterns and deployment options

### **Validation Checklist:**
```bash
# PR author should verify:
□ All deleted development files restored
□ Complete FastAPI implementation included
□ JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance implemented
□ Security middleware added
□ Comprehensive tests included
□ Documentation updated
□ Backward compatibility preserved
□ Migration guide provided
```

## 🎯 **Final Recommendation**

### **Current Status**: ❌ **CHANGES REQUESTED** (Confirmed)

### **After Fixes**: ✅ **READY FOR APPROVAL**

The HTTP/JSON-RPC integration is an **excellent addition** that will significantly expand the accessibility of Greptile MCP tools. However, the current PR has implementation gaps that must be addressed.

### **Key Strengths of the Concept:**
- ✅ **Valuable feature**: HTTP access opens MCP tools to web applications
- ✅ **Standards compliance**: JSON-RPC 2.0 is the right choice
- ✅ **Architecture potential**: Can leverage refactored modular structure

### **Required Improvements:**
- 🔧 **Complete implementation**: Show all FastAPI code
- 🔧 **Restore development workflow**: Add back configuration files
- 🔧 **Production readiness**: Security, testing, documentation

### **Expected Outcome:**
Once the identified issues are resolved, this will be a **high-value addition** that maintains backward compatibility while expanding integration possibilities.
