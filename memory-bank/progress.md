# Greptile MCP Progress

## Project Status: Active Development

## What Works
- Project structure and initial documentation.
- Core MCP server implementation in `src/main.py` with defined tools.
- Greptile client implementation in `src/utils.py` for API interactions.
- Configuration management using environment variables.
- Basic error handling and logging setup.

## What's In Progress
- Adding type hints and input validation for robustness.
- Implementing rate limiting awareness for API calls.
- Drafting comprehensive documentation (`README.md`).
- Setting up project infrastructure files (`pyproject.toml`, Dockerfile).

## What's Left To Build
- [ ] Core Implementation
  - [x] Complete `src/main.py` with FastMCP server
  - [x] Complete `src/utils.py` with Greptile client
  - [x] Create environment configuration system
  - [x] Implement error handling and logging
  - [ ] Enhance streaming support for query responses

- [ ] Project Infrastructure
  - [x] Create `pyproject.toml` with dependencies
  - [x] Set up `.env.example` template
  - [x] Create Dockerfile
  - [x] Write README.md with usage instructions
  - [ ] Finalize deployment instructions and scripts

- [ ] Testing
  - [ ] Set up unit tests for client functionality
  - [ ] Create integration tests for MCP tools
  - [ ] Test with actual Greptile API credentials

- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Add detailed API documentation
  - [ ] Create usage examples
  - [ ] Document error codes and troubleshooting

## Known Issues
- Limited streaming support in MCP tools for query responses.
- Missing comprehensive testing framework.
- No caching mechanism for frequent API calls.

## Completed Milestones
- Initial project structure defined.
- Core requirements documented.
- Project scope and architecture established.
- Core MCP server and Greptile client implemented.

## Next Milestone
Implement a comprehensive testing framework and finalize deployment setup for a production-ready MVP with full repository indexing and querying capabilities.
