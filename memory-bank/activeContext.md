# Greptile MCP Active Context

## Session Information
- **Session Start**: May 04, 2025
- **Session Type**: Production/Completion
- **Status**: Completed
- **Operator**: evilbastardxd

## Current Context
The Greptile MCP implementation has been successfully completed with all 11 planned tasks and 27 subtasks marked as done. The system is now production-ready with the hardset session ID functionality for persistent memory across conversations, providing seamless code repository search, querying, and analysis capabilities to AI agents.

Key features of the completed implementation:
- Complete MCP server with four essential tools
- Async client for Greptile API communication
- Enhanced streaming capabilities for real-time feedback
- Rate limiting awareness to prevent API throttling
- Caching mechanism to improve performance and reduce API usage
- Memory bank for persistent context storage
- Docker deployment capabilities
- Support for both SSE and stdio transport
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- Complete documentation and deployment instructions

## Recent Operations
- Completed all remaining tasks
- Updated memory bank with completion status
- Verified successful implementation of all features
- Achieved 100% completion rate for both main tasks and subtasks

## Repository Status
The main Greptile MCP repository is now production-ready with the following components:
- `src/main.py`: Core MCP server implementation with enhanced streaming
- `src/utils.py`: Greptile client implementation with rate limiting and caching
- Various configuration and deployment files
- Memory bank for persistent storage
- Comprehensive test suite for unit and integration testing
- Complete documentation including API docs, usage examples, and troubleshooting

## Next Actions
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Monitor performance and gather user feedback
3. Consider potential future enhancements based on usage patterns

## Notes
- The hardset session ID eliminates the need for manual session management
- Memory bank provides persistent context across all interactions
- All tasks have been completed with a 100% completion rate
- The implementation is production-ready with all planned features
