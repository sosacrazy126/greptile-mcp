# Greptile MCP Active Context

## Current Development Stage
The Greptile MCP project is in the active implementation phase. The core structure and initial code for the MCP server and Greptile client have been developed.

## Current Focus
1. Refining the implementation with type hints, validation, and logging.
2. Enhancing the Greptile client with rate limiting support.
3. Finalizing project documentation and setup instructions.
4. Planning for testing and deployment strategies.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented the core MCP server in `src/main.py` with tools for repository operations.
- Created the Greptile client in `src/utils.py` for API interactions.
- Added type hints and input validation for repository parameters.
- Introduced logging for better debugging and monitoring.
- Updated dependency specifications in `pyproject.toml`.
- Drafted a comprehensive `README.md` for user guidance.

## Active Decisions
- Using FastMCP as the MCP server framework.
- Implementing async patterns for all API calls.
- Supporting both SSE and stdio transport methods.
- Using environment variables for configuration.
- Adding rate limiting awareness to manage API usage.

## Open Questions
- How should we handle streaming responses more effectively in MCP tools?
- What specific testing scenarios should be prioritized for the Greptile client?
- Should we implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed repository data?
- What level of error reporting detail should be exposed to users?

## Next Steps
1. Implement unit and integration tests for the client and server components.
2. Finalize the Dockerfile and deployment instructions.
3. Address open questions regarding streaming and error reporting.
4. Create detailed API documentation and usage examples.

## Current Blockers
- Need to test with actual Greptile API credentials.
- Integration testing with MCP consumer systems.
