## Project Completion

The Greptile MCP project has successfully completed all planned tasks with a 100% completion rate for both main tasks (11/11) and subtasks (27/27). The implementation now provides a robust, production-ready system with:

1. Enhanced streaming capabilities for real-time query responses
2. Rate limiting awareness to prevent API throttling
3. Efficient caching for frequent API calls
4. Comprehensive testing coverage
5. Complete documentation and deployment instructions
6. Memory bank for persistent context storage
7. Hardset session ID for simplified session management
