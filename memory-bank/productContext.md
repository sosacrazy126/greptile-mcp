# Greptile MCP Product Context

## Problem Statement
AI assistants need access to accurate and relevant code context to effectively help developers. However, implementing code search and analysis capabilities directly in AI systems is complex and often leads to fragmentation in approaches and quality.

## Solution
Greptile MCP provides a standardized interface between AI assistants and the Greptile code search and analysis API. By implementing the MCP protocol, we enable any compatible AI assistant to:

1. Index repositories for later querying
2. Search for relevant code files based on natural language queries
3. Generate detailed answers with code references using the indexed repositories
4. Retrieve metadata about indexed repositories

## User Experience Goals
- **For Developers**: Simplify the process of enabling their AI assistants to access code context
- **For AI Assistants**: Provide a consistent, reliable interface for accessing code search capabilities
- **For End Users**: Enable more accurate and contextual coding assistance when working with repositories

## Key Use Cases
1. **Repository Understanding**: AI assistants can query a codebase to understand its structure and functionality
2. **Code Search**: Users can find relevant code snippets based on natural language descriptions
3. **Implementation Assistance**: AI can provide implementation suggestions with references to similar patterns in the codebase
4. **Documentation Generation**: Generate documentation based on repository contents

## Target Audience
1. AI assistant developers
2. DevOps engineers deploying code analysis tools
3. Software developers using AI assistants for coding tasks

## Value Proposition
Greptile MCP bridges the gap between AI assistants and code repositories, enabling more contextual and accurate coding assistance without requiring each AI system to implement its own code analysis capabilities.
