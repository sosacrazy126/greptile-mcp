# Product Context - Greptile MCP Server

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
Modern AI assistants struggle with codebase understanding because:
- **Static Analysis Limitations**: Traditional tools can't understand code semantics and intent
- **Context Loss**: AI assistants lose context when analyzing large codebases
- **Query Complexity**: Developers need to know exact file names and structures to find relevant code
- **Integration Friction**: Existing code analysis tools don't integrate well with AI workflows

### The Solution
Greptile MCP Server bridges this gap by providing:
- **Semantic Code Understanding**: AI-powered analysis that understands code meaning, not just syntax
- **Natural Language Interface**: Ask questions in plain English about any codebase
- **Persistent Context**: Maintain conversation history across multiple queries
- **Universal Integration**: Works with any MCP-compatible AI assistant

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. **Repository Setup**: User provides GitHub/GitLab repository details
2. **Indexing**: Server indexes the repository using Greptile's AI analysis
3. **Natural Queries**: User asks questions like "How does authentication work?" or "Find all database models"
4. **Intelligent Responses**: Server provides detailed answers with code references and explanations
5. **Follow-up Context**: Subsequent questions build on previous conversation context

### Core Interactions

#### Repository Indexing
```
User: "Index the main branch of myorg/myproject"
Server: "Indexing repository... Status: In Progress (45% complete)"
```

#### Natural Language Queries
```
User: "How does the user authentication system work?"
Server: "The authentication system uses JWT tokens implemented in auth.py:
- login() function handles credential validation (line 23)
- generate_token() creates JWT with user claims (line 45)
- verify_token() middleware validates requests (line 67)
[Detailed code snippets and explanations follow]"
```

#### Contextual Follow-ups
```
User: "What happens if the token expires?"
Server: "Based on the authentication system we just discussed, token expiration is handled by:
- refresh_token() endpoint in auth.py (line 89)
- Automatic renewal in the frontend middleware
- Graceful logout if refresh fails"
```

### Value Propositions
